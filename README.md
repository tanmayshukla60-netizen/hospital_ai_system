Smart Patient Registration & Room Allocation System 
This project is a hospital automation prototype meant for ease of patient registration, predicting issues based on symptoms, and room allocation.

 Key Features
1. User Registration
The user identifies himself/herself by name and phone number.
The system checks whether the person is already registered.
If not registered, a new patient profile is created.
If already registered, the previous information is retrieved to speed up the processing.

2. Symptom-Based Issue Prediction
The user supplies symptoms.
It uses a simple prediction logic or model to identify the probable medical issue.
Instruction: The task is to identify the written forms of statements made orally.
Patient ID (unique to every individual)
Visit ID (unique for every visit)

3. Room Allocation
Rooms are checked for availability.
Suppose an empty room exists:
The system assigns the room to the patient.
If all the rooms are full:
The system displays "Room Not Available".
Overview of the System Purpose

This project simulates a basic workflow of a hospital management system:

Fast registration
Predicting issues automatically

Well-organized room allocation
Unique IDs for tracking patients & visits

It can be extended to include:

Backend database
Better symptom prediction
